# Employee Polls Project

Masterschool React part two - welcome to Redux! In big applications, it's all about state management. A lot new stuff to learn in the first place, but amazing to apply throughout the course and in the final project. We built employee polls all from scratch, so I didn't only have the opportunity to work with React and Redux, but also CSS again. ðŸ’›

# About

This is my code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

Run `npm install` and `npm start` to install and launch the project.
Run `npm test` to run tests.

Employee Polls is an app for creating, sharing and answering polls in a team.
A poll always consists of two options: Would you rather A or B?

1. Login => choose a user in the select to login
2. Dashboard => toggle between answered and unanswered polls
3. Poll => click on a poll to display it solitarily, click a radiobutton to choose an option
4. New Poll => add a new poll with two options
5. Leaderboard => See which user asked / answered the most questions
